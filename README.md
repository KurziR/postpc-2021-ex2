I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence. 
I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.

Answer:
First, I need to add a 'TextView' for the button at 'activity_main.xml'.
Second, I need to add a code in the 'MainActivity.java' for the button, so when user will click on this button- the code will run

For the tests:
1. In 'MainActivityTest.java' I will add the same test I added for all the other buttons 
(a test that checks that it calls the right button)
2. In 'AppFlowTest.java' I will check an entire flow including this button
